## Project Purpose

This project was created as part of the HackYourFuture Foundation Project, including frontend interactivity (DOM manipulation and event handling), backend API communication using Node.js, and data persistence with SQL.

In addition to technical skills, the development process strengthens Agile project management practices —
using a Trello board to organize tasks, planning work in sprints, conducting regular meetings and communication checkpoints, and prioritizing backend features like database data fetching and storage. The project demonstrates practical skills in user interaction, game logic, and effective teamwork workflows.
